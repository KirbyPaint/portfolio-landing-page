  <p>Hello, my name is Ash Porter (KirbyPaint). I'm a current resident of beautiful Salem, OR, and have been since around 2006.<br>
      I have been a casual programmer since 2008, after discovering the joys of robotics in middle school. Ever since then,
      I have taken programming classes in both high school and college, as well as tinkered around in my own time. I've made miscellaneous
      projects for my Dungeons & Dragons group (simple die-roller scripts) but I'm hoping to one day pursue a job in the
      computer science industry, as that would be my dream job.</p>

  <p>The below list is a list of projects I have made during my short time with Epicodus.</p>
