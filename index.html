    <!--A good image of me, probably with Maple :)-->

  <p>Hello, my name is Ash Porter (alias KirbyPaint). I'm a current resident of beautiful Salem, OR, and have been since around 2006.<br>
      I have been a <em>very casual</em> programmer since 2008, after discovering the joys of LEGO robotics in middle school. Ever since then,
      I have taken programming classes in both high school and college, as well as tinkered around in my own time. I've made miscellaneous
      projects for my Dungeons & Dragons group (simple die-roller scripts) but I'm hoping to one day pursue a job in the
      computer science industry, as that would be my dream job.</p>

  <p>The below list is a list of projects I have made during my short time with Epicodus.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://kirbypaint.github.io/my-first-webpage/">My First Webpage</a></li>
      <p>This project is a basic site, built to demonstrate simple HTML usage, including an index landing page, linking to other pages, and linking images.<br>
        Link to Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/KirbyPaint/my-first-webpage">Project Link</a></p>
      <li> <a href="https://kirbypaint.github.io/cupcakeshop/">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
      <p>This page demonstrates using CSS stylesheets to modify elements on the page.<br>
        Link to Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/KirbyPaint/cupcakeshop">Project Link</a></p>
        <li> <a href="https://kirbypaint.github.io/restaurant/">Restaurant</a></li>
      <p>This page also is meant to demonstrate basic HTML linking, but the project itself focused more on managing Git branches.</p>
        Link to Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/KirbyPaint/restaurant">Project Link</a></p>
    </ul>

  <h2>About The Programmer</h2>
    <p>Ash has worked a variety of jobs in her short working career, including:
      <ol>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Lead Cashier</span> at a nationwide retail thrift chain</li>
        <li><span style="color: green;">Customer Care Representative</span> for an international window manufacturer</li>
        <li><span style="color: red;">Document Administrator</span> for a rural phone company</li>
        <li><span style="color: purple;">Administrative Assistant</span> for a local accounting firm</li>
      </ol>
