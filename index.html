  <h1>Portfolio Landing Page</h1>

    <!--A good image of me, probably with Maple :)-->

  <p>Hello, my name is Ash Porter (alias KirbyPaint). I'm a current resident of beautiful Salem, OR, and have been since around 2006.<br>

  <p>The below list is a list of projects I have made during my short time with Epicodus.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://kirbypaint.github.io/my-first-webpage/">My First Webpage</a></li>
      <p>This project is a basic site, built to demonstrate simple HTML usage, including an index landing page, linking to other pages, and linking images.<br>
        Link to Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/KirbyPaint/my-first-webpage">Project Link</a></p>
      <li> <a href="https://kirbypaint.github.io/cupcakeshop/">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
      <p>This page demonstrates using CSS stylesheets to modify elements on the page.<br>
        Link to Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/KirbyPaint/cupcakeshop">Project Link</a></p>
        <li> <a href="https://kirbypaint.github.io/restaurant/">Restaurant</a></li>
      <p>This page also is meant to demonstrate basic HTML linking, but the project itself focused more on managing Git branches.<br>

  <h2>About The Programmer</h2>
    <p>I have worked a variety of jobs in my short working career, including:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Lead Cashier</span> at a nationwide retail thrift chain</li>
        <li><span style="color: green;">Customer Care Representative</span> for an international window manufacturer</li>
        <li><span style="color: red;">Document Administrator</span> for a rural phone company</li>
        <li><span style="color: purple;">Administrative Assistant</span> for a local accounting firm</li>
      </ol>
    <p>I have been a <em>very casual</em> programmer since 2008, after discovering the joys of LEGO robotics in middle school. Ever since then,
      I have taken programming classes in both high school and college, as well as tinkered around in my own time. I've made miscellaneous
      projects for my Dungeons & Dragons group (simple die-roller scripts, magical effect generators, etc.) but I'm hoping to one day pursue a job in the
      computer science industry, as that would be my dream job.</p>
    
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobbies currently include programming (of course) but I'm also an avid gamer, a big fan of <em>Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder</em>, and other tabletop RPGs in general. I've also played the guitar since 2010, and even performed at a friend's wedding. I was supposed to perform at a wedding in April, 2020; however the pandemic prevented most of the wedding party from attending.</p>

    <p>This is a PDF that I made for our current custom RPG:</p>
      <a href="character_sheet.pdf" download>Download Link</a>
    <p>For best results, view in Adobe Acrobat. This will allow you to input information and watch how the PDF performs the math. There are bugs right now with the code; unfortunately, my copy of Adobe Acrobat is a few versions behind, and I haven't yet worked out all the bugs (mostly because I was not paid to make this).</p>
    <p>My roommate designed the background image from existing D&D/Pathfinder assets, and I laid out and wrote the code to perform the math in the fillable fields. This has saved me countless hours of math, and runs quite well on my tablet. Overall, most people prefer the old pen-and-paper, but I am quite happy with this little project.</p>
